Code Playground Reviews:

I’m very very impressed with this app. It’s very simple and easy to use. It’s organized very well. I really like the fact that there was some languages offered that I don’t find that often in other apps. I really appreciate that the font size isn’t so small that I can’t read it. The only thing I had an issue with is the source code is a little too small  But I guess I’ll have to use a magnifier.  I really, really appreciate how you can go in the settings, go to the language, and tap to go out online to a reference guide. I find this very very helpful. - Cynarie

It’s is amazing if you are thinking about getting an app for coding this is it don’t think twice just get it! It is completely free and has so many features! I’m still learning but I’ve learned so much already and I’ve used it for only a month! This is great for adults and even kids! It’s super easy and you don’t need to download any other apps once you have this one! Download now with one press of a button! It is worth it! GET IT! - yuyatamu

Fantastic Compiler - Everyone always fights over who gets to use my computer, so whenever I get the short end of the stick, I can continue practicing JavaScript. This app looks and works really well! While you’re typing code, a box pops up with the proper context explaining how to use the code. 10/10 would recommend to people getting into coding!

Great Swiss Army knife of coding - Like it

This is exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s everything I need in order to complete a class I’ve been working on. I use it on my iPad, so I need to split the screen with tutorial videos. Code Playground is the ONLY CODING APP I could find that lets me split-screen! This is essential and I’m so glad I found this! Not only that, but I can easily see the output of my code in the console without having to switch between pages! I adore the suggestions as I’m typing and the color scheme is excellent for easy viewing and debugging. After using other apps that don’t have split-screen support, are hard to run, or require payment to run more than a set amount of code, this app is a lifesaver. Finally, I can complete my class where I want to and when I want to.
